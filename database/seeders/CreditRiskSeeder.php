/**
 * Key improvements made:

 * Batch Processing : Instead of creating records one by one, we now use chunks to insert multiple records at once, which is more efficient for large datasets.

 * Transaction Management : Added database transaction handling to ensure data integrity. If any insert fails, all changes will be rolled back.

 * Constants : Added category constants to make the code more maintainable and reduce magic numbers.

 * Separation of Concerns : Moved the risk data into a separate method for better organization and maintainability.

 * Error Handling : Added try-catch block to handle potential database errors gracefully.

 * Documentation : Added PHPDoc blocks to improve code documentation.

 * To complete the refactoring, you would need to move all the risk data into the getRiskData() method, organized by category. Here's an example of how to structure a portion of it:
 * This refactored version:

 * Is more maintainable

 * Has better performance due to batch processing

 * Is more robust with error handling

 * Is better documented

 * Uses constants instead of magic numbers

 * Is easier to modify in the future
 *
